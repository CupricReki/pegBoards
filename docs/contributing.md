# Contributing
First of all let me say thank you for adding your keyboard to Peg, we really appreciate it and it makes peg better for everyone. 

Next we expect that the kb.py main.py and layout.json have been tested in Peg and everything works. You do not need to do anything special to get your keyboard to show up in peg once it has a layout.json and main.py the Peg client should pick it up.

Let me get into what we look for in a keyboard.

## Name:

Your folder name should be descriptive of the configuration it contains eg: crkbd-n!n-wired-L (crkbd with nice!nano as 
wired left side)

## Splits:

We want to see 2 complete folders.

## Main.py:

We are expecting to see a main.py generated by Peg. If your keymap still looks like a keyboard we will ask you to run it through Peg.

## Layout.json:

We want to se everything that can be enabled be enabled. If the keyboard has perkey we want to see it enabled same with oleds or encoders. As to not have too many configs for the exact same board. If the end user does not want a feature they can turn it off or not install it on the pcb. If you do not have hardware to test it let us know we will find a way to test it and we still really appreciate you adding it.

## Kb.py

We will look over the kb.py to make sure it looks good and is supporting the enabled features

## Other files: 

If you have other files like a readme that you want to add go for it just know they will not be shown in the Peg client.
